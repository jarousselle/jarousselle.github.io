    "text": "Recently I’ve found myself spending way too much time just mindlessly scrolling on TikTok and it’s time for a change. There are so many other forms of media out there that are a little more substantial in content. So here is a list of some of my favorites to serve as a reminder of the options available outside of TikTok.\n\nMusic\nMusic is my all time favorite type of media to consume. I love listening to new music and exploring new genres, as well as listening to my favorites on repeat. Last year I listened to 121,952 minutes of music!\nRight now some of my top artists are Jeff Buckley, Fiona Apple, and Lana Del Rey\n\n\n\nBooks\nLately I haven’t been reading as much as I would like to, but I am trying to work on it. Some of my favorite reads are Everything I Know About Love by Dolly Alderton, Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng, Normal People by Sally Rooney, Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton, and Frankenstein by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. I also log all of the books I read on my Goodreads.\n\n\n\nMovies\nI haven’t ever been a huge fan of movies, but I am starting to get more into them. I feel like there are so many classic films that I have not seen yet. Some of current favorites are MaXXXine, I Used To Be Funny, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and The Edge of Seventeen."
