    "text": "Recently I’ve found myself spending way too much time just mindlessly scrolling on TikTok and it’s time for a change. There are so many other forms of media out there that are a little more substantial in content. So here is a list of some of my favorites to serve as a reminder of the options available outside of TikTok.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.4     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(plotly) # JS plots!\n\n\nAttaching package: 'plotly'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    last_plot\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:graphics':\n\n    layout\n\nlibrary(DT) # JS tables!\nlibrary(leaflet) # JS maps!\nlibrary(leaflet.extras) # leaflet add-ons!\n\n\nMusic\nMusic is my all time favorite type of media to consume. I love listening to new music and exploring new genres, as well as listening to my favorites on repeat. Last year I listened to 121,952 minutes of music!\nRight now some of my top artists are Jeff Buckley, Fiona Apple, and Lana Del Rey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks\nLately I haven’t been reading as much as I would like to, but I am trying to work on it. Some of my favorite reads are Everything I Know About Love by Dolly Alderton, Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng, Normal People by Sally Rooney, Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton, and Frankenstein by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. I also log all of the books I read on my Goodreads.\n\n\n\nMovies\nI haven’t ever been a huge fan of movies, but I am starting to get more into them. I feel like there are so many classic films that I have not seen yet. Some of current favorites are MaXXXine, I Used To Be Funny, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and The Edge of Seventeen."
