Some of my favorite things to do in the area are going to Laguna Beach and shopping at the Irvine Spectrum.\n\n\n\nLaguna Beach\n\n\n\n\nPets\nI have one dog named Jefferson! We rescued him when I was in fourth grade. We think that he is a Tibetan Terrier and Lhasa Apso mix.\n\n\n\nJefferson\n\n\n\n\nHobbies\nIn my free time I love to listen to music, craft, and read. Over the summer I really want to get more into upcycling clothes and also learn to play an instrument.\n\n\n\nHere are some pants I upcycled!"

    "text": "Recently I’ve found myself spending way too much time just mindlessly scrolling on TikTok and it’s time for a change. There are so many other forms of media out there that are a little more substantial in content. So here is a list of some of my favorites to serve as a reminder of the options available outside of TikTok.\n\nScreentime\nHere’s a breakdown of my recent screentime the past few weeks. Clearly I have spent way too much time on my phone, especially TikTok.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly) # JS plots!\nlibrary(DT) # JS tables!\nlibrary(leaflet) # JS maps!\nlibrary(leaflet.extras) # leaflet add-ons!\nscreentime &lt;- read.csv(\"screentime.csv\")\nnames(screentime) &lt;- c(\"Date\", \"App\", \"Time\")\n\n#creating a bar plot of my screentime divided by category\nfig &lt;- ggplot(screentime, aes(fill=App, y=Time, x=Date)) + \n          geom_bar(position=\"dodge\", stat=\"identity\") +\n#setting custom colots \n   scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"pink\",\n                             \"green\",\n                             \"#f94c57\",\n                             \"grey\",\n                             \"#00f2ea\")) +\n#changing labels\n    labs(title = \"Recent Screentime\",\n       x = \"Date (year 2025)\",\n       y = \"Time (hours)\") +\n#changing theme\n    theme_light()\n#making the bar graph interactive\nggplotly(fig)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic\nMusic is my all time favorite type of media to consume. I love listening to new music and exploring new genres, as well as listening to my favorites on repeat. Last year I listened to 121,952 minutes of music!\nRight now some of my top artists are Jeff Buckley, Fiona Apple, and Lana Del Rey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks\nLately I haven’t been reading as much as I would like to, but I am trying to work on it. Some of my favorite reads are Everything I Know About Love by Dolly Alderton, Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng, Normal People by Sally Rooney, Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton, and Frankenstein by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. I also log all of the books I read on my Goodreads.\n\n\n\nMovies\nI haven’t ever been a huge fan of movies, but I am starting to get more into them. I feel like there are so many classic films that I have not seen yet. Some of current favorites are MaXXXine, I Used To Be Funny, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and The Edge of Seventeen."
