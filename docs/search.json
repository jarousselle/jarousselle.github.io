    "text": "Recently I’ve found myself spending way too much time just mindlessly scrolling on TikTok and it’s time for a change. There are so many other forms of media out there that are a little more substantial in content. So here is a list of some of my favorites to serve as a reminder of the options available outside of TikTok.\n\nScreentime\nHere’s a breakdown of my recent screentime the past few weeks. Clearly I have spent way too much time on my phone, especially TikTok.\n\n\nCode\n# loading in packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly) # JS plots!\nlibrary(DT) # JS tables!\nlibrary(leaflet) # JS maps!\nlibrary(leaflet.extras) # leaflet add-ons!\n\n# storing data as screentime and adjusting names\nscreentime &lt;- read.csv(\"screentime.csv\")\nnames(screentime) &lt;- c(\"Date\", \"App\", \"Time\")\n\n#creating a bar plot of my screentime divided by category\nfig &lt;- ggplot(screentime, aes(fill=App, y=Time, x=Date)) + \n          geom_bar(position=\"dodge\", stat=\"identity\") +\n#setting custom colots \n   scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"pink\",\n                             \"green\",\n                             \"#f94c57\",\n                             \"grey\",\n                             \"#00f2ea\")) +\n#changing labels\n    labs(title = \"Recent Screentime\",\n       x = \"Date (year 2025)\",\n       y = \"Time (hours)\") +\n#changing theme\n    theme_light()\n#making the bar graph interactive\nggplotly(fig)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic\nMusic is my all time favorite type of media to consume. I love listening to new music and exploring new genres, as well as listening to my favorites on repeat. Last year I listened to 121,952 minutes of music!\nRight now some of my top artists are Jeff Buckley, Fiona Apple, and Lana Del Rey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks\nLately I haven’t been reading as much as I would like to, but I am trying to work on it. Some of my favorite reads are Everything I Know About Love by Dolly Alderton, Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng, Normal People by Sally Rooney, Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton, and Frankenstein by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. I also log all of the books I read on my Goodreads.\n\n\n\nMovies\nI haven’t ever been a huge fan of movies, but I am starting to get more into them. I feel like there are so many classic films that I have not seen yet. Some of current favorites are MaXXXine, I Used To Be Funny, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and The Edge of Seventeen."

    "text": "Background\nFall quarter of 2024, I worked as an intern for Your Children’s Trees (YCT) to help plant hundreds of Eucalyptus trees. This was crucial for restoring a critical habitat for Monarch Butterflies. Although Eucaly[ptus trees are not native to the area, the butterflies have adapted to their presence and now rely on them for protection from the wind. However, after dealing with drought conditions, many of the trees died off, leaving the butterflies at Ellwood Mesa vulnerable. As Monarch populations have continued to decline, this project was an essential effort for protecting their habitat and maintaining the area.\n\n\nJob\nAs an intern, I worked to plant trees with other interns and helped lead and instruct groups of volunteers.\n\n\nPictures"

    "text": "Background\nOver the course of Spring quarter 2025, I have been collecting data to determine if the type of shoe I wear impacts my walking pace. To do this, I recorded my walks on my Apple Watch and also wrote down the type of shoe I was wearing. I then compiled all of this data into a spreadsheet so that I can analyze the data in RStudio and create an affective visualization.\n\n\nProgress\n\nInitial Visualization\nHere is an initial visualization of the data to see if shoe type impacts my walking pace. From the graph, it appears that I have a slower walking pace when wearing Doc Martens than I do when wearing sneakers. This is expected because Doc Martens are less comfortable shoes. The boxplot below compares some of the central tendencies of the data like median, interquartile range, max, and min.\n\n\nCode\n# reading in packages and setting working directory\nsetwd('/Users/jessrousselle/Desktop/github/jarousselle.github.io')\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# reading in data\nshoe &lt;- read.csv(\"posts/stats/shoe_data.csv\")\n\n# creating a plot\nplot &lt;- ggplot(shoe, aes(x = Type_of_Shoe,\n                 y = Pace_min,\n                 fill = Type_of_Shoe)) +\n# setting custom colors\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#B2A5A0\", \"#2E69AC\")) +\n# creating boxplot\n         geom_boxplot() +\n# jittering points horizontally, but not vertically\n         geom_jitter(width = 0.2,\n                     height = 0) +\n# changing labels\n  labs(title = \"Effects of Shoe Type on Walking Pace\",\n       x = \"Type of Shoe\",\n       y = \"Walking Pace (min)\") +\n# changing theme\n  theme_linedraw()\n# making plot interactive\nggplotly(plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffective Visualization Draft\nFrom this data, I am creating an affective visualization of shoe type and walking pace. I am doing this by drawing on my ipad and creating a plot. The x-axis shows walking pace, with the faster pace being closer to the finish line. Each shoe represents a data point for walking pace and the type of shoe I was wearing when that data was recorded. This is still a work in progress, but here is my draft.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Project\nComing soon!"
