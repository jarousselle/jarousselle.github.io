title: "Favorite Media"

Recently I've found myself spending way too much time just mindlessly scrolling on TikTok and it's time for a change. There are so many other forms of media out there that are a little more substantial in content. So here is a list of some of my favorites to serve as a reminder of the options available outside of TikTok.

# Music

Music is my all time favorite type of media to consume. I love listening to new music and exploring new genres, as well as listening to my favorites on repeat. Last year I listened to 121,952 minutes of music!

Right now some of my top artists are Jeff Buckley, Fiona Apple, and Lana Del Rey.

# Books

Lately I haven't been reading as much as I would like to, but I am trying to work on it. Some of my favorite reads are *Everything I Know About Love* by Dolly Alderton, *Little Fires Everywhere* by Celeste Ng, *Normal People* by Sally Rooney, *Jurassic Park* by Michael Crichton, and *Frankenstein* by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. I also log all of the books I read on [my Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/roussellej073).

# Movies

I haven't ever been a huge fan of movies, but I am starting to get more into them. I feel like there are so many classic films that I have not seen yet. Some of current favorites are *MaXXXine, I Used To Be Funny, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Fantastic Mr. Fox,* and *The Edge of Seventeen*.
