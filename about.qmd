# Where I'm From

I'm from Orange County, CA. I have lived in this area for almost my entire life. Some of my favorite things to do in the area are going to Laguna Beach and shopping at the Irvine Spectrum.

# Pets

I have one dog named Jefferson! We rescued him when I was in fourth grade. We think that he is a Tibetan Terrier and Lhasa Apso mix.

# Hobbies

In my free time I love to listen to music, craft, and read. Over the summer I really want to get more into upcycling clothes and also learn to play an instrument.
