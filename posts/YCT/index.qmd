# Background

Fall quarter of 2024, I worked as an intern for Your Children's Trees (YCT) to help plant hundreds of Eucalyptus trees. This was crucial for restoring a critical habitat for Monarch Butterflies. Although Eucaly\[ptus trees are not native to the area, the butterflies have adapted to their presence and now rely on them for protection from the wind. However, after dealing with drought conditions, many of the trees died off, leaving the butterflies at Ellwood Mesa vulnerable. As Monarch populations have continued to decline, this project was an essential effort for protecting their habitat and maintaining the area.

# Job

As an intern, I worked to plant trees with other interns and helped lead and instruct groups of volunteers.
